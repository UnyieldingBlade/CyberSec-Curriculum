## 🎯 Objective
Master vulnerability discovery, assessment, and Linux hardening techniques. Learn to identify, prioritize, and mitigate real security risks using enterprise-class tools.

---

## 🧠 Quiz Topics

- Define CVE and explain the CVSS scoring system.
- Compare OpenVAS and Nessus as vulnerability scanners.
- Identify and explain key Linux hardening techniques.
- Demonstrate how to interpret and remediate vulnerability scan results.

---

## 📖 Reading

- [NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [OpenVAS Documentation (Greenbone)](https://docs.greenbone.net/GSM-Manual/gos-22.04/en/scanning.html)
- [CIS Benchmarks — Linux](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/linux/)

## 🛠️ Lab Environment Setup

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Scanner VM:** Kali Linux (with OpenVAS)
- **Target VM:** Ubuntu Server (intentionally outdated/unpatched)

### Required Tools

- OpenVAS (Greenbone)
- CVE database (web-based)
- Linux hardening tools: `ufw`, `fail2ban`, `chkrootkit`, `lynis`

---

## ⚔️ Practical Tasks

**Task 1: Vulnerability Scanning**
- Install and configure OpenVAS on Kali.
- Scan the Ubuntu target VM for vulnerabilities.
- Export and analyze the scan report (identify high/critical findings).

**Task 2: Vulnerability Assessment**
- Research CVEs and CVSS scores for top findings in your scan.
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, exploitability, and impact.

**Task 3: Linux System Hardening**
- Apply at least five CIS Benchmark Linux hardening recommendations on your target VM.
  - Examples: Disable root SSH, enforce strong passwords, restrict unused services, enable `ufw`/`fail2ban`.
- Re-scan to validate risk reduction.

**Task 4: Remediation Documentation**
- Create before-and-after evidence (screenshots/config output).
- Summarize lessons learned and persistent vulnerabilities (if any).

---

## 📌 Weekly Deliverable (Mandatory)

- **Vulnerability Assessment & Hardening Report** (`week8_vuln_hardening.md`):
  - OpenVAS scan summary (before/after hardening).
  - List of vulnerabilities found, prioritized by CVSS.
  - Detailed hardening steps with evidence.
  - Final summary: risk posture improvement and next steps.

---

## 🚩 Success Criteria

- Confident use of a vulnerability scanner in a real-world lab.
- Correct interpretation and prioritization of scan results.
- Tangible reduction of vulnerabilities via Linux hardening.
- Clean, actionable documentation and evidence of remediation.

---

## ✅ Week 8 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Completed all readings and OpenVAS docs.
- [ ] Scanner and target VMs built and configured.
- [ ] Vulnerability scan performed and hardening actions executed.
- [ ] Weekly deliverable (`week8_vuln_hardening.md`) completed and added to portfolio.

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Never scan or attempt to harden systems you do not own or have explicit authorization for.
- Take VM snapshots before hardening to allow rollback.
- Save all scan reports and configs for future reference.

Vulnerability assessment is not theory—move, scan, harden, and document your path to true security.
