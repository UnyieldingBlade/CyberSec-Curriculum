## üéØ Objective
Develop core automation skills by mastering Bash scripting for system administration, security monitoring, and report generation.

---

## üß† Quiz Topics

- Construct and explain Bash control structures (loops, if-else, functions).
- Redirect input/output, use pipes, and chain commands efficiently.
- Utilize `cron` for task scheduling.
- Apply text-processing tools (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`) for log analysis.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Practical Tasks

**Task 1: Bash Scripting Fundamentals**
- Write scripts to automate file operations (backups, file organization).
- Use variables, conditionals, and loops in all scripts.
- Ensure all scripts are commented and executable.

**Task 2: Log Processing & Report Generation**
- Create scripts that parse `/var/log/auth.log` (or equivalent) for failed/successful logins.
- Output summaries in clean, readable format.

**Task 3: Cron Job Automation**
- Schedule automated log parsing or backup scripts using `cron`.
- Document the process for adding and verifying scheduled jobs.

**Task 4: Text Processing Mastery**
- Use `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to extract specific security-relevant events from system logs.
- Chain multiple commands for advanced filtering and reporting.

## üìå Weekly Deliverable (Mandatory)

- **Security Report Generator Script** (`security_report.sh`):
  - Automates log parsing and outputs summary of relevant security events.
  - Accepts date range or event type as argument (bonus: email the results).

- **Documentation (`week4_bash_automation.md`)**:
  - Explanation of script logic and functionality.
  - Evidence of cron job setup and output samples.

---

## üö© Success Criteria

- Efficiently build, debug, and execute Bash scripts.
- Confidently automate security and admin tasks.
- Clean documentation and robust script output.

## ‚úÖ Week 4 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Completed assigned readings.
- [ ] VMs and all required tools set up.
- [ ] All practical tasks executed (scripts, cron, text-processing).
- [ ] Weekly deliverables (`security_report.sh`, `week4_bash_automation.md`) completed and added to portfolio.

## üö® Important Notes

- Scripts must be clean, well-commented, and secure (no unnecessary sudo use).
- Test all automation in a controlled VM before applying to production systems.

No theory without output. Build, automate, and document‚Äîmove fast, move clean.
