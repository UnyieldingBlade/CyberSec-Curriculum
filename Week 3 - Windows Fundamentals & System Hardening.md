## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Environment Setup

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Primary VM:** Windows 10 Enterprise (Evaluation ISO)
- **Support VM:** Kali Linux VM (from Weeks 1‚Äì2)

### Required Tools

- Built-in: Event Viewer, `gpedit.msc`
- Sysinternals Suite: Process Monitor, Autoruns, TCPView, Process Explorer

## ‚öîÔ∏è Practical Tasks

**Task 1: Group Policy Hardening**
- Configure a basic Group Policy baseline (password complexity, account lockouts, user permissions).
- Document your configured GPO settings clearly.

**Task 2: Event Log Exploration & Monitoring**
- Access and navigate the Event Viewer.
- Identify critical security events (failed logins, system events).
- Save and export event logs for review.

**Task 3: System Hardening via Sysinternals**
- Utilize Autoruns to disable unnecessary startup items and services.
- Analyze system processes with Process Explorer for suspicious activity.
- Document all modifications clearly and concisely.

---

## üìå Weekly Deliverable (Mandatory)

- **Windows Hardening & Monitoring Report** (`week3_windows_hardening.md`):
  - Documented GPO settings (screenshots and text summaries).
  - Summary of critical security events captured.
  - Changes made via Sysinternals (Autoruns, Process Explorer findings).

---

## üö© Success Criteria

- Confident use of GPOs to enforce security baselines.
- Familiarity with navigating and interpreting Windows Event Logs.
- Practical understanding and use of Sysinternals Suite tools for system auditing and hardening.
